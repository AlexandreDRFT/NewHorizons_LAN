Windows software developed in Electron + Python to show open LAN rooms in Animal Crossing New Horizons using servers of LANPlay (https://github.com/spacemeowx2/switch-lan-play).

It emulates a Nintendo Switch and the UDP requests it sends to the LANPlay servers, parses the servers response and displays it with a GUI.
